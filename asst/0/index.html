<div class="paragraph">
<p>After completing ASST0 you should:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Have set up your OS/161 development environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the source code structure of OS/161.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be comfortable navigating the OS/161 sources to determine where and how
things are done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have been introduced to Git and GDB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be able to, modify, build and run your first OS/161 kernel.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_a_note_on_cut_and_paste"></a><h3>1.2. A Note on Cut-and-Paste</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another assignment objective is to get you working efficiently in a Linux
development environment using standard command-line development tools.
Unlike many of the things you will find online ASST0 is <em>not a tutorial.</em>
You will go slower, but you will learn a lot more from figuring out how to:
&quot;Run the first OS/161 thread test and then shut down your kernel&quot; than how
to:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="spelling_exception">trinity@zion:~$ sys161 kernel &quot;tt1;q&quot;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following these kinds of written instructions will also better prepare you to
interact with other OS/161 hackers in person and in the online forum.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_a_note_on_learning_git"></a><h3>1.3. A Note on Learning Git</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another objective of this course is to help you learn to use common
development tools, particularly Git.
However, like most programming tools the best way to learn Git is through the
extensive online documentation and multiple good online tutorials
(<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/" target="_blank" class="external">1</a>,
<a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1" target="_blank" class="external">2</a>,
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=git%20tutorial" target="_blank" class="external">etc.</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a result, we have removed Git coverage from this introduction.
Any documentation we could provide is unlikely to be complete and up-to-date,
and this will also provide you with good practice in online learning.
Feel free to ask your course staff or other students for help, either in
person or using the forum.
Chances are many of them use Git on a daily basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like anything else, learning Git takes practice, more practice, and patience.
But here&#x2019;s one tip: <strong>read the output generated by Git commands.</strong>
Git produces remarkably useful output, particularly when an error occurs or
when it didn&#x2019;t accomplished what you wanted.
Frequently the output tells you <em>exactly</em> what to do to fix the problem&#x2014;&#x200B;down
to the commands that you should type.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="_download_the_os161_source_code"></a><h3>3.1. Download the OS/161 Source Code</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We distribute the <a href="https://github.com/ops-class/os161" target="_blank" class="external"><code>ops-class.org</code> OS/161 source code</a>
using Git.
Starting with a clone of our repository makes it easy for us to distribute
updates, which can be merged easily into your repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, choose a directory to work in:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are using our Vagrant virtual machine,
you can run Git either inside or outside of your virtual machine, assuming
your host machine has Git installed. For simplicity, we suggest cloning the
sources inside your virtual machine in <code>/home/trinity/src</code>, which should be
an empty directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have the toolchain installed natively you can create your source
directory wherever you want.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#x2019;s say you&#x2019;ve chosen a directory called <code>src</code>, which should either not
exist or (in the case of the Vagrant VM) be empty. Clone
<a href="https://github.com/ops-class/os161" target="_blank" class="external">our <code>ops-class.org</code> Git repository.</a> into that directory.
Note that we refer to this directory as your <em>source directory</em>. In contrast,
your <em>root directory</em> is where your built kernel and other binaries are
installed and where you run <code>sys161</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_configure_your_os161_source_tree"></a><h3>3.2. Configure Your OS/161 Source Tree</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next step is to configure the OS/161 sources by running the <code>configure</code>
command located at the base of your source tree. You need to do this (very
short) step only when you completely remove your source tree for some reason.
The only configuration step is to set up where various binaries&#x2014;&#x200B;including
system executable and your kernel&#x2014;&#x200B;will be created when you run <code>make</code> in
later steps. Run <code>configure --help</code> to find out more including available
command line options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that by default OS/161 installs things to the root directory
<code>$HOME/os161/root</code>, which is a fine plan to put things if you are working on
a shared machine. For our dedicated VM we use <code>$HOME/root</code> to shorten the
directory paths a bit, but this requires that you use the <code>--ostree</code> argument
to <code>configure</code>. If you forget this argument either now or when you need to
rerun <code>configure</code> later, you will install things into <code>$HOME/os161/root</code>.
<strong>This has caused confusion for some students previously, so please be
careful.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_configure_your_os161_kernel"></a><h3>3.3. Configure Your OS/161 Kernel</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The kernel sources for OS/161 are in the <code>kern</code> subdirectory, which has its
own configuration script. Change into <code>kern/conf</code> and look around. You should
notice a configuration script, a base configuration file (<code>conf.kern</code>), and
four configurations that include <code>conf.kern</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should take a look at <code>conf.kern</code> and one of the configurations to get a
sense of the format. But for now, the only thing we&#x2019;re concerned about is
ensuring that we enable <code>dumbvm</code> for this assignment. You&#x2019;re going to write a
full-fledged virtual memory (VM) system in <a href="/asst/3/" class="hidden-print">ASST3</a>, but for the first few
assignments <code>dumbvm</code> provides enough of a &quot;dumb&quot; VM to allow you to proceed.
Configure a kernel now with <code>dumbvm</code> enabled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OS/161 kernel configuration process sets various options that control how
your kernel gets built, so unlike the configuration step above you will
probably need to modify these files at some point during later assignments.
In particular, <code>conf.kern</code> determines what source files get included in your
kernel build, so if you add sources to the kernel you&#x2019;ll need to add them to
<code>conf.kern</code> as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_build_your_os161_kernel"></a><h3>3.4. Build Your OS/161 Kernel</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you&#x2019;re successfully configured your OS/161 kernel you should have a
directory to compile in, as well as a reminder about a build step that you
might forget. Once you change into that directory you are ready to build a
kernel!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One important note before you start. You are probably used to using
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/" target="_blank" class="external">GNU <code>make</code></a> to build software on UNIX-like
systems. However, the OS/161 sources use
<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/bmake" target="_blank" class="external">BSD <code>make</code></a>, which has a different
<code>Makefile</code> syntax <span class="badge footnote default-tooltip" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Why? Because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~dholland/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;David Holland&lt;/a&gt; is a big &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netbsd.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;NetBSD&lt;/a&gt; hacker.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">3</span>. To avoid confusion, BSD <code>make</code> has
been installed on your system as <code>bmake</code>. So while you might normally run
<code>make clean</code> to reset your build and remove all of the build targets, when
working with OS/161 you would run <code>bmake clean</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Building the dependencies (<code>bmake depend</code>)</strong>. This scans all of the source
files that you have configured to be part of your kernel and ensures that all
their header files are also included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building the kernel (<code>bmake</code>)</strong>. This generates your kernel binary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Installing the kernel (<code>bmake install</code>)</strong>. This installs your kernel into
the root directory that you configured above.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Run these three commands now and check that they complete successfully. Then
change into your root directory and look around. You should see a fresh
kernel. If you don&#x2019;t, review the steps above until your kernel builds
successfully.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_configuring_sys161"></a><h3>3.5. Configuring <code>sys161</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you have a kernel, the next step is to run it.
But how?
Given that your kernel doesn&#x2019;t yet have any useful features, it would be
impossible to run it on real hardware, or even in a fully-featured VM like
VirtualBox.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, OS/161 kernels are built to be run by a special-purpose system
simulator called <code>sys161</code>, or System/161.
Compared to other VMs or full-system simulators, <code>sys161</code> is simpler and
faster but retains enough realism to enable OS/161 kernel development.
Apart from floating point support and certain issues relating to RAM cache
management, it provides an accurate emulation of a MIPS processor
<span class="badge footnote default-tooltip" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;If you&amp;#x2019;d like to know more about System/161 and OS/161, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=563383&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; provides an excellent overview.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">4</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike OS/161, we <em>do not</em> expect you to modify <code>sys161</code>. However, you do
need to <em>configure</em> the simulated machine that <code>sys161</code> provides by choosing
the number of simulated CPU cores, the amount of simulated memory, and the
number of simulated disk drives. <a href="/files/sys161.conf">Here is a
<code>sys161.conf</code> file</a> that you can use to get started. You should read and
understand the structure of this configuration file so that you can modify it
as needed in later assignments.</p>

<p>Now that you have a kernel and a <code>sys161</code> configuration file you should be
ready to go. Fire up your kernel and see what happens. Poke around a bit at
the menu. Run a test or two. And then shut down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What just happened? You ran one computer program (<code>sys161</code>) that loaded your
kernel (from the <code>kernel</code>) file. Your kernel is itself a program expressed as
a series of MIPS r3000 instructions, which were interpreted by <code>sys161</code> and
simulated as if they had executed on real hardware. Of course, this includes
the ability read from and write to a console device, allowing you to interact
with your running kernel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examine the output produced by your kernel as it boots and shuts down. You
should be able to answer the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Which version of System/161 and OS/161 are you using?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where was OS/161 developed and copyrighted?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much memory and how many CPU cores was System/161 configured to use?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What configuration was used by your running kernel?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many times has your kernel been compiled?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before going on try the following exercises:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Boot your OS/161 kernel with 8 cores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try booting with 256K of memory. What happens?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure System/161 to use a fixed value to initialize its random number
generator. (This can be helpful when debugging non-deterministic kernel
behavior.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_kernel_development_workflow"></a><h3>3.7. Kernel Development Workflow</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you saw above, building an OS/161 kernel from scratch involves five steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Configuring the entire OS/161 source tree by running <code>configure</code> in the
root of the source directory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configuring the kernel by running <code>config</code> in the <code>kern/conf</code> subdirectory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building the dependencies by running <code>bmake depend</code> in the compilation
subdirectory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building the kernel by running <code>bmake</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installing the kernel by running <code>bmake install</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step only needs to be done when you download a new OS/161 source
tree. The second step only needs to be done when you start a new assignment
or add files to your kernel build by editing <code>kern/conf/conf.kern</code>.
Rebuilding the dependencies in step three is also not usually necessary
unless you have reconfigured your kernel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So that leaves the last two (<code>bmake ; bmake install</code>) as your normal kernel
development workflow. Note that <code>bmake</code> is usually smart enough to detect
what you changed and not recompile things unnecessarily, but if you think
that it hasn&#x2019;t accomplished that correctly you can always run a <code>bmake clean</code>
to force it to start over.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if things aren&#x2019;t building properly you may want to rerun the kernel
configuration and dependencies steps just to be sure. Step 1 is almost never
necessary to repeat unless you&#x2019;ve completely started over and removed your
entire previous OS/161 source tree.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_building_the_user_space_tools"></a><h3>3.8. Building the User Space Tools</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you change into your root directory you should see only a few files,
including your compiled kernel, a symbolic link pointing to that kernel, and
the <code>sys161.conf</code> file that configures <code>sys161</code>. That&#x2019;s fine for now, and all
your need until <a href="/asst/2/" class="hidden-print">ASST2</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But your OS/161 kernel would not be very interesting or useful if it couldn&#x2019;t
run user programs. So let&#x2019;s build those now. Head over to the base of your
source directory and run <code>bmake</code> followed by <code>bmake install</code>. This generates
a lot of output, but when it&#x2019;s done return to your root directory. You should
see a directory structure including <code>bin</code> and <code>testbin</code> directories
containing cross-compiled user binaries that your OS/161 kernel will
eventually be able to run.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that building the user space tools is <em>not</em> part of the kernel
development cycle. Unless you modify or add tests in the <code>userland</code>
subdirectory of your source directory&#x2014;&#x200B;which you are encouraged to do&#x2014;&#x200B;you
should not need to rebuild or reinstall these binaries. And until you begin
<a href="/asst/2/" class="hidden-print">ASST2</a> your kernel can&#x2019;t run user binaries anyway, so this part of the build
process is completely useless. We only point this out because compiling and
installing the user space tools takes enough time to be annoying, so don&#x2019;t
let it slow you down unnecessarily. Focus your development loop on your
kernel.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>One of the core challenges of the <code>ops-class.org</code> assignments is working with
OS/161, a large, complicated, and unfamiliar code base.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OS/161 contains roughly 40K non-commenting lines of code and 25K comments
spread across 570 C, header, and assembly files. Reading and understanding
all of that code would take much more time than you want to spend. And of
course you are going to make things worse, since your solutions will add
considerably to what is already there <span class="badge footnote default-tooltip" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;The ASS3 solution set adds 4K LoC.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">5</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Luckily, OS/161 contains a large amount of code that you never need to
understand or change, some amount of code that you need to be familiar but
not intimate with, and a small amount that you must understand in detail.
Distinguishing between these categories is critical to your success. For
example, the <code>LAMEbus</code>, <code>semaphore</code>, and <code>loadelf</code> source code each fall into
one of these three categories. See if you can decide which is which, or
return to this question after you work on some of the questions below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To become familiar with a code base, there is no substitute for actually
poking around. Browse through the tree a bit to get a sense of how things are
structured. Glance through some source code for files that look interesting.
OS/161 is also very well commented, as befits a pedagogical code base.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the OS/161 sources are C source (<code>.c</code>) and header (<code>.h</code>) files. Your
kernel does also contain a bit of assembly code (<code>.S</code>) files. You will not
need to understand or modify the assembly code, but it does contain some
fairly interesting pieces of code executed during boot and during context
switches. So you may want to take a look at it at some point. The assembly
code is also <em>extremely</em> well commented <span class="badge footnote default-tooltip" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Thanks David!&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">6</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should use the code reading questions below to guide an initial
exploration of the OS/161 sources. While the questions won&#x2019;t require you look
at every line of code or even every file, we <em>strongly recommend</em> that you at
least glance at all the kernel sources in the <code>kern</code> subdirectory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some parts of the code may seem confusing since we have not discussed how any
OS/161 subsystems work. However, it is still useful to review the code now
and get a high-level idea of what is happening in each subsystem. If you do
not understand the low-level details now, that is fine.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="_the_top_of_the_source_directory"></a><h3>4.1. The Top of the Source Directory</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your OS/161 source directory contains the following files:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>CHANGES</code>: describes the evolution of OS/161 and changes in previous
versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>configure</code>: the top-level configuration script that you ran previously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Makefile</code>: the top-level <code>Makefile</code> used to build the user space binaries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The source directory contains the following subdirectories:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>common/</code>: code used both by the kernel and user programs, mostly standard C library functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>design/</code>: contains design documents describing several OS/161 components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>kern/</code>: the kernel source code, and the subdirectory where you will spend
most of your time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>man/</code>: the OS/161 man pages appear here.  The man pages
document (or specify) every program, every function in the C library, and
every system call. You will use the system call man pages for reference in
the course of <a href="/asst/2/" class="hidden-print">ASST2</a>. The man pages are HTML and can be read with any browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>mk/</code>: fragments of <code>Makefiles</code> used to build the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>userland/</code>: user space libraries and program code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have previously configured and built in this directory there are also
some additional files and directories that have been created, such as
<code>defs.mk</code> and <code>build/</code>.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_user_land"></a><h3>4.2. User Land</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the <code>userland/</code> source subdirectory, you will find:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>bin/</code>: all the utilities that are typically found in
<code>/bin/</code>&#x2014;`cat`, <code>cp</code>, <code>ls</code>, etc. Programs in <code>/bin/</code> are considered
fundamental utilities that the system needs to run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>include/</code>: these are the include files that you would typically find
in <code>/usr/include</code> (in our case, a subset of them).  These are user include
files, not kernel include files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>lib/</code>: library code lives here.  We have only two libraries:
<code>libc</code>, the C standard library, and <code>hostcompat</code>, which is for recompiling
OS/161 programs for the host UNIX system.  There is also a <code>crt0</code> directory,
which contains the startup code for user programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sbin/</code>: this is the source code for the utilities typically found in
<code>/sbin</code> on a typical UNIX installation. In our case, there are some utilities
that let you halt the machine, power it off, and reboot it, among other things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>testbin/</code>: these are pieces of test code that we will use to
test and grade your assignments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You don&#x2019;t need to understand the files in <code>userland/bin/</code>, <code>userland/sbin/</code>,
and <code>userland/testbin/</code> now, but you certainly will later on. Eventually, you
will want to modify these or write your own utilities and these are good
models. Similarly, you need not read and understand everything in
<code>userland/lib</code> and <code>userland/include</code> but you should know enough about what&#x2019;s
there to be able to get around the source tree easily.  The rest of our code
walk-through is going to focus on <code>kern/</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#x2019;s navigate to the <code>kern/</code> source subdirectory. Once again, there is a

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>Successfully developing an OS/161 kernel requires more than just building and
running a kernel. You also need to edit source code, share code with others,
and debug and test your kernel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To complete ASST0, we&#x2019;ll provide an overview and some exercises using the
rest of the OS/161 toolchain: in particular,  Git and GDB. But let&#x2019;s start
with discussing how to edit OS/161 source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_editing_os161"></a><h3>5.1. Editing OS/161</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While we don&#x2019;t specifically support any particular editing or code browsing
software, we suggest that you use an editor that is designed for working with
source code. Command line tools like <code>vim</code> work well and, when combined with
<code>ctags</code> and <code>tmux</code>, produce a very powerful command-line development
environment. Graphical editors like Eclipse or Visual Studio are also fine
but more of a hassle to set up. Decide what works best for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you read and begin to modify source code, you will also want to absorb
it&#x2019;s stylistic conventions. Like any other hacker, David Holland has his
preferences about indentation, line width, function signatures, where to put
braces, and tabs versus spaces. Adopting these will make it much easier to
work on OS/161 and ensure that your changes fit in. This is also a critical
skill to learn as you begin to contribute to other shared code bases. At
minimum, you and your partner should agree on style so that you don&#x2019;t drive
each other crazy or spend hours reformatting each others&apos; code.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As described previously, we are not going to go into the use of Git in
detail. <strong>But we will point out that using Git is not optional for completing
the <code>ops-class.org</code> assignments.</strong> We distribute our base sources using Git
and will use Git to push updates to you. Our testing tool, <code>test161</code>, submits
assignments for testing using Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One additional requirement is that you have a <em>private</em> Git repository so
that you do not inadvertently share your solutions with others. The <code>test161</code>
submission system will refuse to grade your assignments if it detects that
your Git repository is public. Getting your hands on a private Git repository
is not hard. If you are a student,
<a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank" class="external">GitHub</a> will allow you to set
up a limited number of private repositories for instructional use.
<a href="https://www.gitlab.com" target="_blank" class="external"><code>GitLab.com</code></a> provides private Git repositories for
free, as do other sites such as
<span class="spelling_exception"><a href="https://www.bitbucket.org" target="_blank" class="external">BitBucket</a></span>. And your course
staff may also set up private Git repositories for you to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are completing the <code>ops-class.org</code> assignments alone, you may wonder
whether you need Git. The short answer is <strong>yes</strong>. Every programmer, including
you, should get in the habit of setting up version control every time you
start a project. It&#x2019;s the first thing that you should do. Always. Every time.
No exceptions. Why? There are a lot of reasons.

<p>Modify your kernel so that it prints out your email address at the right
spot during boot. Use Git to show what files have changed. Commit your
changes, and confirm that your work tree is now clean. Use Git to show the
history of your repository, and to generate a line-by-line breakdown of who
is responsible for each of the current lines in the file that prints the
menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify your kernel so that it prints a bad word during boot. Use Git to
show what files have changed. Decide that this is bad idea and use Git to
back out your change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify your kernel so that it builds but does not boot. (Try adding a null
pointer exception somewhere during the boot sequence or in the menu.) Check
in your changes and build a kernel. Run your kernel and realize your mistake.
Use Git to revert your previous commit containing the mistake. Confirm that
your kernel now builds and boots properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat the previous exercise but make your changes in a new branch. When
you realize your mistake, return to your master branch and show that you can
still build and boot. At that point abandon and delete the new branch you
created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up a private remote repository so that you and your partner can share
changes. Configure your repository so that it pushes and pulls your master
branch to your new repository by default. Pick a file to edit jointly,
something long enough so that you both can add changes. Add a comment to the
top of the file. Have your partner add a comment to the bottom of the file.
Use Git to merge your changes through the remote repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick another file to edit jointly, but this time create a conflict by both
adding different comments to the same line of the file. Using Git, confirm
that the edits create a merge conflict. Use Git to handle the conflict and
complete the merge. Try doing this twice and see if you can force each
partner to handle the merge conflict.</p>

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 hidden-print" style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; border:1px solid grey">
<div class="youtube-container" data-id="BcbqC74DEy0"><img class="youtube-thumb" src="//i.ytimg.com/vi/BcbqC74DEy0/mqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube placeholder"><div class="play-button"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play" aria-hidden="true"></span></div></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GDB&#x2014;&#x200B;or the GNU debugger&#x2014;&#x200B;is another extremely well-documented tool which we
will let you learn on your own. Unlike Git, GDB is not required to complete
the <code>ops-class.org</code> assignments. But that&#x2019;s like saying that shoes aren&#x2019;t
required to climb Mt. Everest. You can make it without GDB, through good old
<code>printf</code> debugging and pure deductive reasoning. But it will be very, very
painful. You will be much happier if you learn to use GDB.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only complication to using GDB to debug your OS/161 kernel is that the
machine simulator <code>sys161</code> gets in the way. As a result, the way that you
hook up the debugger to your running kernel is a bit different than you might
be used to if you have used GDB previously. For example, if you try this in
your root directory:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash lang-bash" data-lang="bash">os161-gdb sys161 kernel</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>you will end up debugging <code>sys161</code>, not your kernel, which is not what you
want. And if you run</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash lang-bash" data-lang="bash">os161-gdb kernel</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>nothing will happen at all because you haven&#x2019;t started the <code>sys161</code> simulator
required to run your kernel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, you need to start the simulator and the debugger separately.
However, it is critical that they run in the same directory. A terminal
multiplexer like <code>tmux</code> comes in handy here. Here&#x2019;s what to do:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>In one terminal, change to your root directory and start your kernel. There
is a special option to <code>sys161</code> that will cause it to wait for a connection
from the debugger before booting. Use that to make sure that you can
establish the connection before boot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a second terminal, change to your root directory and start the debugger
by running <code>os161-gdb kernel</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, you are not quite done. You may have noticed that the kernel
is still waiting for a debugger connection. To establish that connection,
type the following at the GDB prompt:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash lang-bash" data-lang="bash">target remote unix:.sockets/gdb</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point GDB should confirm that it is connected to the <code>sys161</code>
simulator and you can proceed. Note that the kernel is stopped at this point
as if you have set up a breakpoint, so you need to instruct it to continue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Happily, new versions of <code>sys161</code> will wait explicitly at shutdown for a
debugger connection if something goes wrong. Try booting your kernel and
running the <code>panic</code> command to observe this behavior. This gives you a chance
to connect a debugger and poke around in cases where your kernel panics and
you weren&#x2019;t expecting it. <strong>That said, we suggest that you always run your
kernel with the debugger attached from boot.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you get tired of typing these commands, there are ways to set up a GDB
alias for the <code>target</code> command and have it be run when GDB starts. For the
even more adventurous, you can set up a <code>tmux</code> script that will automatically
create two windows, boot your kernel in one and start the debugger in the
other. Programming FTW!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, note that because GDB is debugging your kernel through the <code>sys161</code>
system simulator, not all GDB features are supported. Watchpoints, for
example, are known not to work. In addition, when stepping through code you
should keep in mind that your kernel is multithreaded and that other threads
may have run in-between each step.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="_gdb_exercises"></a><h4>5.3.1. GDB exercises</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are just getting started with GDB, here are some exercises specific to
OS/161 that you may want to try:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set a breakpoint on the <code>panic</code> function. Initiate a panic from the kernel
menu and confirm that GDB hits the break point. Inspect the call stack and
step up and down a few times before allowing the kernel to continue and
<code>sys161</code> to exit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a panic by modifying your OS/161 source code. Use GDB to find the
source of the panic. If you are working with a partner, have your partner
hide a panic in the source code and use GDB to find it. Then hide one for
them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step through kernel boot, stepping in to and over a few of the boot helper
functions that initialize various subsystems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put a breakpoint on the kernel exception handler and step through it when
it fires. Use it to determine what generates exceptions when your kernel is
sitting idly at the menu.</p>
</li>
</ul>
