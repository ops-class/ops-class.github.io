<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
dumpsfs - dump information about an SFS filesystem
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/sbin/dumpsfs</tt> <em>raw-device</em><br>
<tt>host-dumpsfs</tt> <em>disk-image-file</em>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>dumpsfs</tt> dumps out selected information regarding the contents
and structure of the SFS filesystem on the device it is passed.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Like <a href="mksfs.html">mksfs</a>, it is also compiled for the
System/161 host OS, and in that form can access System/161&apos;s disk
image files.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>dumpsfs</tt> uses the following system calls:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="../syscall/open.html">open</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/read.html">read</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/write.html">write</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/lseek.html">lseek</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/fstat.html">fstat</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/close.html">close</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/_exit.html">_exit</a>
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p>
Since the fstat system call is not normally part of the basic system
calls assignment, <tt>dumpsfs</tt> will usually still not function
after that assignment is completed.
The fstat call is typically part of a later assignment, usually the
file system assignment.
Consult your course materials for specific information.
</p>

<p>
The host version of <tt>dumpsfs</tt>, since it runs outside of OS/161,
should always work regardless of what you have and have not
implemented.
</p>

<p>
Note that you may wish to extend dumpsfs in the course of doing the
file system assignment.
