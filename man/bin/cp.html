<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
cp - copy files
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/bin/cp</tt> <em>oldfile</em> <em>newfile</em>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>cp</tt> copies the file <em>oldfile</em> to the file <em>newfile</em>,
overwriting <em>newfile</em> if it already exists.
</p>

<p>
<tt>cp</tt> supports no options.
</p>

<p>
Note that <tt>cp</tt> does <em>not</em> support the Unix idiom
<tt>cp file1 file2 ... destination-dir</tt> to copy a number of files
at once. In particular, <tt>cp foo bar/</tt> will fail, probably with
&quot;Is a directory&quot;.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>cp</tt> uses the following syscalls:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="../syscall/open.html">open</a>
</li><li><a href="../syscall/read.html">read</a>
</li><li><a href="../syscall/write.html">write</a>
</li><li><a href="../syscall/close.html">close</a>
</li><li><a href="../syscall/_exit.html">_exit</a>
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p>
<tt>cp</tt> should function properly once the basic system calls
assignment is completed.
</p>
