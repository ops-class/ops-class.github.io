<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
rmdir - remove directory
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/bin/rmdir</tt> <em>directory</em>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>rmdir</tt> removes the specified directory. The directory must be empty.
</p>

<p>
It is an error to attempt to remove the . or .. names in a directory,
or to apply rmdir to a filesystem object that is not a directory.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>rmdir</tt> uses the following system calls:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="../syscall/rmdir.html">rmdir</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/write.html">write</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/_exit.html">_exit</a>
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p>
As the rmdir system call is generally not part of the basic system
calls assignment, <tt>rmdir</tt> will usually still not function after
the basic system calls assignment is complete.
This call is typically part of a later assignment, usually the file
system assignment. You may also need to implement subdirectories in
the file system.
Consult your course materials for specific information.
</p>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>
<a href="../dev/emu.html">emufs</a> does not support <tt>rmdir</tt>.
(This is intentional.)
</p>
