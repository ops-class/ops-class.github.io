<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
forkbomb - create hundreds of processes
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/forkbomb</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>forkbomb</tt> does
</p><pre>   while (1) fork();
</pre>
doing a bit of additional checking similar to that done by
<a href="forktest.html">forktest</a>.
<p></p>

<strong>
DO NOT RUN THIS ON A REAL SYSTEM - IT WILL GRIND TO A HALT AND
PEOPLE WILL COME AFTER YOU WIELDING BASEBALL BATS AND/OR THE AD
BOARD<sup><font size="-1">*</font></sup>. WE WARNED YOU.
</strong>

</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>forkbomb</tt> uses the following system calls:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="../syscall/fork.html">fork</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/getpid.html">getpid</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/write.html">write</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/_exit.html">_exit</a>
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p>
We don&apos;t expect your system to withstand this without grinding to
a halt, but once your basic system calls are complete it shouldn&apos;t
crash. Likewise for after your virtual memory system is complete.
</p>

<p>
Note that this may turn out to be hard to achieve in practice. Don&apos;t
spend much time fixing problems <tt>forkbomb</tt> triggers that won&apos;t
arise under more normal operation. (If in doubt, consult your course
staff.)
