<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
rmtest - test removing open files
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/rmtest</tt>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>rmtest</tt> deletes a file while it&apos;s open and then attempts to do
further I/O to it, and tries to check that the right things happen.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>rmtest</tt> uses the following system calls:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="../syscall/fork.html">fork</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/execv.html">execv</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/waitpid.html">waitpid</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/open.html">open</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/read.html">read</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/write.html">write</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/lseek.html">lseek</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/close.html">close</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/_exit.html">_exit</a>
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p>
<tt>rmtest</tt> also spawns a copy of
<a href="../bin/rm.html">/bin/rm</a>, which uses these system calls:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="../syscall/remove.html">remove</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/write.html">write</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/_exit.html">_exit</a>
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p>
<tt>rmtest</tt> should run correctly once the file system assignment
is complete.
</p>

<h3>Bugs</h3>
<p>
There&apos;s no particular reason it should use <tt>/bin/rm</tt> instead of
calling <a href="../syscall/remove.html">remove</a> itself. But I guess
it makes life more exciting.
</p>
