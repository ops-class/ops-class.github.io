<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
f_test - basic concurrent filesystem test
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/f_test</tt> [<tt>1</tt>|<tt>2</tt>|<tt>3</tt>]
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>f_test</tt> consists of three tests, 1-3, that can be specified on
the command line. If nothing is specified, all three tests are run.
</p>

<p>
Test 1 writes a large file (a bit over 270k) and reads it back.
</p>

<p>
Test 2 creates and removes a directory tree, rather like
<a href="dirtest.html">dirtest</a>.
</p>

<p>
Test 3 spawns three subprocesses that simultaneously read and write
the same file.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>f_test</tt> uses the following system calls:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="../syscall/fork.html">fork</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/execv.html">execv</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/waitpid.html">waitpid</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/open.html">open</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/read.html">read</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/write.html">write</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/close.html">close</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/mkdir.html">mkdir</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/rmdir.html">rmdir</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/remove.html">remove</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/_exit.html">_exit</a>
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p>
<tt>f_test</tt> should run correctly once the file system assignment
is complete.
</p>
