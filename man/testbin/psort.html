<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
psort - concurrent file system test
</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
<tt>/testbin/psort</tt> [<tt>-p</tt> <em>numprocs</em>]
[<tt>-k</tt> <em>numkeys</em>] [<tt>-r</tt> | <tt>-s</tt> <em>randomseed</em>]
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<tt>psort</tt> does an on-disk parallelizing sort of a large number of
randomly generated integers.
It is loosely based on some real parallel sort benchmarks.
</p>

<p>
Be aware of its size vs. the size of your buffer cache, and adjust its
size as needed. Running it so it fits entirely in cache and running it
so it overflows the cache are both valid stress tests, but have quite
different characteristics.
</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<ul>
<li> <tt>-k</tt> Set the number of integers. Default is 131072.
</li><li> <tt>-p</tt> Set the number of processes. Default is 4.
</li><li> <tt>-r</tt> Get a random seed from the <tt>random:</tt> device.
</li><li> <tt>-s</tt> <em>randomseed</em> Choose an explicit random seed.
</li></ul>
<p>
The memory footprint depends on the number of processes and the
per-process work buffer size (which can be changed at compile time);
the file system footprint depends on the number of integers.
Specifically, the memory footprint is the number of processes (default
4) times the buffer size (default 384K), and the file size is the
number of integers (default 131,072) multiplied by the size of an
integer (here 4) multiplied by the maximum number of copies of the
data that appear at once, which is 3, so 1.5 MB.
</p>

<p>
Note that the parent psort process does not serve as one of the worker
processes; it also has a work buffer, but doesn&apos;t use it.
Also note that it forks several (six) sets of subprocesses in the
course of execution.
A virtual memory system that doesn&apos;t support the zerofilled page
optimization will both use 1/n more memory for the extra work buffer
and also incur a fairly large cost copying it in every fork.
Also, because of the large number of forks the amount of RAM required
to run psort using dumbvm is likely prohibitive.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<tt>psort</tt> uses the following system calls:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="../syscall/open.html">open</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/dup2.html">dup2</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/read.html">read</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/write.html">write</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/lseek.html">lseek</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/close.html">close</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/stat.html">stat</a> or
     <a href="../syscall/fstat.html">fstat</a> (optional)
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/remove.html">remove</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/fork.html">fork</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/execv.html">execv</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/waitpid.html">waitpid</a>
</li><li> <a href="../syscall/_exit.html">_exit</a>
</li></ul>
It also execs <a href="../bin/cat.html">cat</a>.
<p></p>

<p>
<tt>psort</tt> should be able to run properly on SFS filesystems once
the basic system calls are implemented. However, you may need to
adjust its workload size depending on the level of large-file support
you have in SFS.
</p>

<p>
<tt>psort</tt> will mostly run on emufs, but there isn&apos;t really much
point in that.
